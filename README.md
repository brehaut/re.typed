# re.typed

A Clojure library designed to handle the same regular expression opperations as the `re-*`
functions in `clojure.core` but in a way that doesn't result in core.typed forcing you to handle
a massive type union explosion.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[re.typed :as re])

(re/find re/all #"(ab+)+c" "ZZabbabcZZ") 
;=> ["abbabc" "ab"]
(re/find re/groups #"(ab+)+c" "ZZabbabcZZ") 
;=> ["ab"]
(re/find re/match #"(ab+)+c" "ZZabbabcZZ") 
;=> "abbabc"
(re/find re/found #"(ab+)+c" "ZZabbabcZZ") 
;=> true
```

`re/find`, `re/matches` and `re/seq` correspond to `re-find`, `re-matches` and `re-seq` from core,
but each takes an additional first argument to parameterize how to return the Matchers result.
